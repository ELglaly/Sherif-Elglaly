I found that he was always ready to work and to push others to do the work they were supposed to do. Also, I noticed that he has great skills and ambitions in the software engineering field. He was in charge to lead his team during the developing of the SRS and implementation as well. I recall that I asked his team permission to share their first draft because they did a very good job.</p>

    about: "My name is Sherif Shawshen. preferred by Sherif Elglaly. I am a senior Software Engineering student at Assiut University, currently ranked fourth in my department, and a USAID Scholar as a recipient of a USAID scholarship for my bachelor's degree.\n\nWhen I first started studying Software Engineering, my goal was to improve my skills in software development and its applications. While this focus helped me do well academically, I've always wanted to learn more beyond what was required in my courses. My experiences during my studies, internships, and exchange program have shaped my skills, aspirations, and desire to continue my education.",
